class Door

  # - display an inscription
  # - be either open or closed, and
  # - be either locked or unlocked


  ### Q: could I use different naming convention. Of using lockedness?, openess?
  # coded as is, they could be booleans.
  ### Q: could I instantiate amount of descriptions used? Like set description_amount = 1.
