thought I could build it similarly to the planet_hash.
#   attr_accessor :name, :display, :
#
# # name, display, is_door_open , is_door_Locked
#   def initialize(door_hash)
#     @name = door_hash[:name]
# # You may open a Door if and only if it is unlocked and closed
#     @is_door_open = [:is_door_open false] && @is_door_locked = false
#     @is_door_Locked =
#   end
#
# end
